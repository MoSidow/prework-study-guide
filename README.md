# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

My motivation to have successfully completed this Prework Study guide is the determination I have to become a professional coder.

This Prework Study Guide was created for boot camp students who were going through the Prework. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.

Throughout this Prework I have learnt all the basic Coding skills that i thought i would have never understood. Furtunately, thanks to the clear instructions provided, i mangaged to successfully create my first web application!
